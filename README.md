# Weather Dashbord

This app allows users to search any US city and get today's weather and the forecast for the next 5 days. The temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index is shown, along with an icon representing the weather. The UV index is color coded. Additionally, past searches are stored and can be searched again by clicking on them in the side bar. 

Currently the forecast function is still under developmet. 

The finished app looks like this:
